// fontPointSize), not an abstract Small/Medium/Large slot.

// The Korean build does not use upstream's SD-card font registry to enumerate
// installed point sizes: its reader font is KoPub Batang or a single-size SD
// .epdfont picked in FontSelectionActivity. Only the built-in set below is
// selectable, so the registry-aware readerFontPointSizes() upstream ships is
// not carried here.

// The built-in Noto Serif / Noto Sans families are compiled in at exactly these
// point sizes (see the global font objects in main.cpp).

// smaller size. Takes a raw range rather than a vector because getReaderFontId()
// runs inside the page render loop and must not allocate.
